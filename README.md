## Description

For this assignment, we create a employee directory with React. This assignment will break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.

## Installation

 
## Usage
![GIF]() 

On the main page, you'll have a table filled with employee's information. To sort by first name, click on the "First Name" section 

On the search page, you'll have two buttons categories, one for male and one for female. Click on the button and it'll output a table of that specific category.
